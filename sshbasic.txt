Server side

ssh = secure shell 
use for communication between server-linux and client-linux

install
sudo apt-get install openssh-server

start 
service ssh start

check
service ssh status

stop
service ssh stop

check ip address
ifconfig

we can config at
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
before config must make a backup
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config etc/ssh/ssh_config.bak



=======================================
There are 3 way to create connection with ssh server
1. password
2. Public/Private Key Pair
3. Host Based


1. password
===========
at server side turn on ssh-server
~$ service ssh start
-----------------------------------------
to access for ssh server
$ssh nikhom@192.168.1.106 
and enter password
exit 

------------------------------------------
2.Public/Private Key Pair
=========================
at server side turn on ssh-server
~$ service ssh start

at client side creat key (piblic(send to server) / private(keep in client)

ssh-keygen mean to create keys or use ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 for more secure

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa mean to add client key before sending to server

ssh-copy-id nikhom@192.168.1.103 mean to copy public key to server, done !!!

ssh nikhom@192.168.1.103 mean connect to server

-------------------------------------------

To copy file to server with keys

scp ~/test/supera.txt nikhom@192.168.1.103:~/servertest

============================================
3. Public/Private Key Pair for DigitalOceanLike
dockerbase/openssh-server = DigitalOcean

at client side
ssh-keygen -t rsa mean to create another key gen
/home/nikhom/.ssh/id_rsa_do mean enter a file name in which to save the key (/home/nikhom/.ssh/id_rsa): 
id_rsa_do  id_rsa_do.pub mean what we get new key in .ssh
cat id_rsa_do.pub mean to display public key and copy it
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_do mean to add new key to ssh of client

at Server
sudo apt get update
sudo apt get upgrade

adduser mee mean creat a new user 
usermod -aG sudo mee mean put new user to sudo group
id mee mean cheak id mee , we got 27(sudo) as admin user

login mee mean login in mee
mkdir .ssh
touch .ssh/authorized_keys mean to create authorized_keys under mee
past client id_rsa_do.pub to authorized_keys by using nano
cat authorized_keys mean to check new key in file
~/.ssh$ sudo chmod -R 700 . mean to change file permission to 700

sudo -i mean to login as root user
service ssh start mean to start ssh-server by root user
ifconfig mean to check ip address of server

at client side
ssh mee@172.17.0.2 mean we can login to server as mee user

scp ~/test/b.txt mee@172.17.0.2:~/servertest mean we can scp file to server to test

at client side 
ssh mee@172.17.0.2 mean to login to server
sudo -i mean change to root at server

for security purpose we do not allow rootlogin to server 
cd /etc/ssh
nano ssh_config
PermitRootLogin no mean not allow root login from client
sudo systemctl reload sshd mean might not work just restart at server service ssh stop/start under root account

tip
sudo chown -R mee:mee /home/folder mean to change owner of folder to mee
